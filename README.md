# Ephemeris Data Analysis for Orbital Dynamics
Retrieves and analyzes ephemeris data from NASA's Horizons system to study the orbital dynamics of Jupiter's Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) over a 175-year period. Using Python, we visualize key parameters such as eccentricity and orbital distance to understand their long-term behavior. Ideal for research and educational purposes in celestial mechanics.
